This is a repository of my personal notes collected during the various analyses of <i>Micranthes petiolaris</i> species within the southern Blue Ridge Escarpment

These notes are not a tutorial, but a raw record of trial and error for individual analyses.

You will see note's like, "that didn't work" and so forth.
