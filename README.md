This is a repository of my personal notes collected during the various population genomic analyses of SNP and whole genome data

These notes are not a tutorial, but a raw record of trial and error for individual analyses.

You will see notes like, "that didn't work" and so forth.  

Puntuation adn spelling may be wrong
